            </center>
            <p>The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family - the Pandavas and Kauravas - who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. Interwoven into this narrative are several
                smaller stories about people dead or living, and philosophical discourses. Krishna-Dwaipayan Vyasa, himself a character in the epic, composed it; as, according to tradition, he dictated the verses and Ganesha wrote them down. At 100,000
                verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. The events in the epic play out in the Indian subcontinent and surrounding areas. It was first narrated by a student
                of Vyasa at a snake-sacrifice of the great-grandson of one of the major characters of the story. Including within it the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata is one of the most important texts of ancient Indian, indeed world, literature.</p>

                                    asked him to display the powers on a tree. He asked him to treat each leaf of the tree as enemy & make a hole trough them.While Babarika was meditating, Krishna plucked a leaf off the tree and hid it under his own feet.The
                                    first arrow was shot and it marked all the leaves in red ink.The second arrow punched holes in every leaf marked with the red ink and…..and it pierced through Krishna’s feet to reach for the hidden leaf. <br><br>Krishna
                                    was shocked and realized that there was nothing that could possibly stop the infallible powers of Barbarik. Krishna then asked Barbarik about the side he was planning to fight for in the war of Mahabharat. Babrbarik
                                    expressed his desire to fight for the Pandavas as they were the weaker side. (as promised to his guru). But Krishna then revealed the paradox of Barbarik’s impossible promise: since the power of the 3 arrows made him
                                    the most powerful warrior on the battlefield, whichever side he joined would make the other side weaker. Eventually, he would end up switching sides infinitely until he destroyed everyone but himself. So to avoid this
                                    consequence, Krishna asked for Barbarik’s head.But Barbarik expressed his desire to witness the epic battle of Mahabharat. Krishna promised him that even after his head was severed from his body, his head would be in
                                    a conscious state and that it would be placed on a hill overlooking the battlefield, so that he could witness the whole war.Barbarik, being a true warrior and disciple of Lord Krishna, readily agreed and severed his
                                    own head.

                                    When the great King Yudhishtir’s quest to win at the dice game took over the best of him, he pawned his own wife. Draupadi was dragged forcefully and mercilessly to the court, before the noblest of men. These warriors, possessing complete ability to bring
                                    the savage scene to a halt, preferred being mute spectators when the drunk-with-power Duryodhana ordered the commencement of the shameful act- unclothing of Draupadi. Everyone stayed mum. Well, everyone except Vikarna.
                                    <br><br>Vikarna made his voice heard against the whole idea of the dice game. And when began the mistreatment of his sister-in-law, he became more anxious to stop the whole deal for once and all. He echoed Draupadi’s
                                    questions, which she had already raised before the Kuru leaders regarding the celebration of shame that centred around her. At this, Karna was enraged and he taunted Vikarna for his outburst. This was clearly not taken
                                    well by Duryodhana who then asked Vikarna to quit voicing his opinions. Nothing helped. Even the leaders who were considered the wisest of heads did nothing to stop the evil and save the victim. However, Vikarna emerged
                                    as the one who wouldn’t shut and see the wrong brewing before his eyes. In a world outside Mahabharata, when a girl is humiliated and harassed before a mute mob, the person who dares to pull her to safety is harassed
                                    too.

                                    King Brihadratha, was married to the twin daughters of the king of Kashi. Brihadratha loved both his wives equally but had no sons. The sage Chandakaushika visited his kingdom and gave fruit to the king as a boon. The king divided the fruit equally between
                                    both of his wives. Soon, both wives became pregnant and gave birth to two halves of a human body. These two lifeless halves were very horrifying to view, so Brihadratha ordered them to be thrown in the forest. A demoness
                                    named Jara found the two halves and picked up one with her right hand, one with her left, holding each piece in her palm. When she brought both of her palms together, the two pieces joined, becoming a living child.
                                    The child cried loudly, which caused Jara to panic. Not having the heart to eat a living child, Jara took the baby to the king and explained to him all that had happened. The father was overjoyed to see his son. After
                                    the death of King Kansa of Mathura, his father-in-law, Jarasandha was so angry that he decided to kill Lord Krishna and Balarama. </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Mahabharata, Jarasandha attacked Sri Krishna and Balarama 17 times. But Lord Krishna used to leave Jarasandha alive every time. THIS WAS BECAUSE, Jarassandha brings the unrighteous from all over the world
                                    in front of us in the war. That is why we are able to kill all the unrighteous in one place; we do not have to go anywhere else to kill all these evil people. When all the wicked and the unrighteous are killed in the
                                    war, then we will kill Jarasandha too. As Jarasandha was a powerful warrior, it was necessary for the Pandavas to eliminate him. Krishna, Bhima and Arjuna disguised as brahmins traveled to Magadha and met Jarasandha.
                                    After a formal meeting, Jarasandha enquired about their intentions.<br><br> Krishna, Bhima, and Arjuna revealed their actual identities. Krishna then challenged Jarasandha for a duel and gave him the freedom to choose
                                    any one belligerent. Jarasandha selected Bhima for a duel. Both Bhima and Jarasandha were accomplished wrestlers. The duel continued for several days and neither of them was willing to give up. After along battle, Jarasandha
                                    grew tired. Krishna then hinted Bhima that when fatigued, a person might die if pressed too hard. Bhima understood Krishna's hint, lifted Jarasandha in the air and pressed his knee against Jarasandha's backbone, killing
                                    him instantly.

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Prime Minister of the Kuru Kingdom</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/4.jpg" alt="..." />
                                <p style="text-align:justify;">
                                    Barring Krishna, Vidura was most respected as an adviser by the Pandavas, whom he forewarned on various occasions of Duryodhana's plots to exterminate them, such as Duryodhana's plan to burn them alive in the house of wax. Excepting the prince Vikarna,
                                    Vidura was the only one who protested against the humiliation of Draupadi in the Kaurava court. In that moment, Duryodhana viciously rebuked Vidura, calling him ungrateful. Dhritarashtra moved to rebuke Duryodhana for
                                    insulting Duryodhana's uncle, but, remembering Vidura saying that a blind man cannot be king, holds his tongue, and instead reprimanded Duryodhana for insulting the prime minister. It is that incident that Vidura brought
                                    up years later when he severed ties with the Kurus and sided with the Pandavas at the onset of the Kurukshetra war. Unlike Bhisma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, Karna, etc., Vidura did not have an obligation to Hastinapur
                                    or Duryodhana, but to his family. Hearing Dhritarashtra not acknowledge that relationship, Vidura felt compelled to side with dharma and the Pandavas.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify;"> According to Krishna, Vidura was considered as Dharmaraja, which means the lord of truth. Krishna respected Vidura for his devotion to people's welfare, and his proficiency in every sphere of knowledge. When Krishna visited
                                    Hastinapura as a peace emissary of the Pandavas, he shunned Duryodhana's offer to stay in the royal palace, preferring instead the home of Vidura, on account of him being the only neutral man in the Kaurava court. The
                                    reason Krishna stayed in Vidura's chambers for the night instead of Duryodhana's is due to the thoughts which were running through their heads and the difference between them. Duryodhana's intention was to heave luxury
                                    upon Krishna and convince him to join the Kaurava's side. Sensing this intention, Krishna refused. Krishna knew the food that Vidura presented was presented with love and affection with no ulterior movtive. In the Sanatsujatiya
                                    section of the Mahabharata, shortly before the Kurukshetra War began, Vidura invoked the sage Sanatsujata to answer Dhritarashtra's questions about death. In protest against the Kurukshetra War, Vidura resigned from
                                    the post of minister.

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The Charioteer and Advisor of Dhritarashtra</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/5.jpg" alt="..." />

                                    In Mahabharata, the night before the war, the Pandavas and the Kauravas have already discussed the plans and strategies for the first day of the war. Bhisma, aware of the ruins the war would certainly bring, is at unease and wants to do something to prevent
                                    the war. As a last resort, he visits Lord Krishna and asks him for some solution. Lord Krishna tries to explain that the war is unavoidable but offers Bhisma a glimmer of hope. He advises Bhisma to ask Maharishi Ved
                                    Vyasa to visit Dhritarashtra. Ved Vyasa complies and visits Dhritarashtra, who Sanjay is attending to. Maharishi Vyasa admonishes the King for submitting passively to the immoral desires of his sons, esp. Duryodhana
                                    and Dushasana, and tries, albeit unsuccessfully, to persuade Dhritarashtra to act as a mediator between the Kauravas and Pandavas. Furious at Dhritarashtra, Maharishi Vyasa tells him that his name would forever be tainted
                                    for his passivity, which has resulted in a chaotic situation. Showing remorse for his actions and asking for forgiveness, Dhritarashtra then mentions to Vyasa his desire to know the events during the battle and puts
                                    forward a request to bestow upon his charioteer Sanjay the divine vision or Divya Drishti.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify;"> Maharishi Vyasa tells Dhritarashtra that if he wants divine vision, he himself could accept it. Dhritarashtra, fearing that he might have to witness the deaths of his sons and his army, refuses to accept it and asks him
                                    to grant Sanjay the divine vision. Sanjay, being loyal to his master, accepts it with grace. After being endowed with Divya Drishti, Sanjay, at the request of King Dhritarashtra, starts to explain to him everything
                                    about the then world. This is mentioned at the beginning of Bhisma Parva in the Mahabharata. He describes to his master, in great detail, the diversity of life, his theories on the matter, life forms, geography, etc.
                                    During the battle, Sanjay reports everything to Dhritarashtra in great detail. Clear, honest and without taking sides, Sanjay never turns away from reporting the loss of his master’s sons in the battlefield, though
                                    it’s an excruciating job telling a parent the gruesome death of his sons at the hands of the Pandavas. Despite this, he never shies away from narrating the actual events; he, however, comforts Dhritarashtra and Gandhari
                                    whenever he reports the loss of their sons. Along with Arjun, Hanuman, and Barbarika, Sanjay is a direct listener of the Gita, recited by Lord Krishna himself, which he then narrates to his master, King Dhritarashtra.
                                    He is also one of the two witnesses to the Vishwaroop, the universal form of Lord Krishna
